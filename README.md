# SaveLiveMusicATX

Repository for ATX Hack for Change event June 3-5th

Proposal: Use Open Austin to create opensource database/registries of local Austin bands, music venues, and shows. This data should be curated ("verified"), and then made available to anyone that wants to build a website, calendar, app, etc. based on this information.

Objective: Support the people that constitute the heart and soul of The Live Music Capital of the World.
